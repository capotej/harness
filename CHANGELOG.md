# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Summary

Promotes Apple's `container` CLI as the default container runtime on macOS. `HARNESS_CONTAINER_RUNTIME=apple` is no longer needed — harness auto-detects whether `container` is on PATH and prefers it over docker (macOS only; on other platforms a same-named binary is an unrelated tool and docker stays default). Set `HARNESS_CONTAINER_RUNTIME=docker` to force docker. The `apple` value is now a deprecated alias: it still selects the apple runtime but prints a deprecation warning.

### Changes

- Promote container CLI to default runtime via macOS-gated auto-detection (#114)
- Keep `HARNESS_CONTAINER_RUNTIME=apple` as a deprecated alias instead of hard-failing
- Ignore a `container` binary on PATH outside macOS (apple/container is macOS-only)

## [1.9.13] - 2026-08-30

### Summary

Dependency refresh: bumps `hermes-agent` to v2026.8.19 (v0.20.5), `gh` to 2.98.0, and `cosign` to 3.1.3 (with updated release checksums). Drops the `hermes-agent-64189` secret-source re-pull backport patch — the fix is now upstream (hermes-agent #64177) — and removes the now-empty `patches/` directory along with the dead `MISE_VERSION` build-arg.

### Dependency Updates

- updated gh from 2.97.0 to 2.98.0
- updated cosign from 3.1.2 to 3.1.3
- updated hermes-agent from v2026.8.3 to v2026.8.19

## [1.9.12] - 2026-08-18

### Summary

Honors `HERMES_BASE_URL` in the cloud-mode entrypoint, mirroring the existing `HERMES_PROVIDER` handling. When set, the hermes container's `model.base_url` config is populated from the environment instead of being cleared.

### Changes

- ccf2c77 feat(hermes): honor HERMES_BASE_URL in cloud mode entrypoint (#173)

## [1.9.11] - 2026-08-16

### Summary

Fixes the Apple Container runtime pulling the wrong architecture on Apple Silicon (it now passes `--platform` to `image pull`), honors `HERMES_PROVIDER` in cloud-mode entrypoint so multi-key env files can pin the provider, and adds `boldblackai/skills` as a default tap on first run so fresh containers can discover the public skills marketplace without a manual step. The release skill also now opens a cross-repo PR to bump the image tag in `create-dispatch`.

## [1.9.10] - 2026-08-10

### Summary

Adds local text-to-speech via `kokoro-onnx` in the hermes image, and lands integration tests that gate the release pipeline with real end-to-end container smoke tests. Bumps `gh` to 2.97.0 and `hermes-agent` to v2026.8.3 (v0.20.0, The Herald Release). Drops the slack-invalid-blocks patch that was upstreamed in v0.20.0.

### Dependency Updates

**v2026.7.30 (v0.19.1)** — Patch tag rolling up ~1,000 PRs since v0.19.0: bug-fix and salvage waves across the gateway, voice subsystem, desktop app, and installer; Buzz/Nostr channel, FLUX3 video, Telegram media reliability, voice-mode regressions.

**v2026.8.3 (v0.20.0 — The Herald Release)** — Streaming conversational voice with barge-in and on-device wake words across all platforms. Agent-to-Agent protocol (A2A v1.0). Signed outbound webhooks. Grounded research with verifiable citations. Desktop app becomes a platform (artifacts, plugin SDK, quick-entry). CLI power-user wave (`!` shell mode, `/init`, `/diff`, `/context`, `/focus`). Mid-turn redirects. Tool self-recovery wave. Smarter, gentler context compression. Prompt caching covers tool schemas on Anthropic. `hermes -w` cold start 14s → 1.8s. Default tool-call iteration limit 90 → 500. New providers: Gemini 3.1 Pro, Gemini 3.6 Flash, claude-opus-5, deepseek-v4-flash-0731. New platforms: Buzz (Nostr), Vercel AI Gateway. Slack Block Kit clarify buttons, reaction triggers, outbound payload sanitization.

## [1.9.9] - 2026-08-01

### Summary

Fixes cosign image verification failure caused by the release pipeline moving from tag pushes to push-to-main. The identity regexp in `verifyImage` now matches `@refs/heads/main` exactly. Also removes dead code from `docker.yml`: the `release: published` trigger, `type=semver` tag, and `tags/v` ref check — all unreachable since the switch away from tag-push triggers.

### Changes

- 0c5e343 fix: accept refs/heads/main in cosign identity verification (#147)

## [1.9.8] - 2026-08-01

### Summary

Fixes the base Docker image version tag. The `merge-base` job in `docker.yml` only produced version-tagged base images on tag refs, not on release commits pushed to main. Adds a `type=raw` tag gated on the `release v` commit sentinel, matching the `merge-variant` pattern.

### Changes

- f904582 fix: produce version-tagged base image on release commits (#145)

## [1.9.7] - 2026-08-01

### Summary

Consolidates the release pipeline into a single workflow. npm publish (OIDC trusted publishing) is now part of `tag-on-merge.yml` instead of a separate `publish.yml`, fixing a GitHub Actions limitation where a `GITHUB_TOKEN`-pushed tag cannot trigger another workflow. Docker `merge-variant` jobs detect release commits on push to main and produce version-tagged images directly.

### Changes

- 4089aad fix: merge npm publish into tag-on-merge workflow (#142)

## [1.9.6] - 2026-08-01

### Summary

Fixes the `tag-on-merge` release workflow to use a `push` trigger instead of `pull_request`, resolving a permission issue where fork PRs receive a read-only `GITHUB_TOKEN` that blocked tag creation. Also removes the old logo from README.md.

> **Not published to npm / no version-tagged Docker images.** The `push` trigger gave the workflow write permissions, but the tag push came from `github-actions[bot]` — GitHub Actions suppresses workflow triggers from `GITHUB_TOKEN`, so `publish.yml` never fired. Fixed in 1.9.7 by merging npm publish into `tag-on-merge.yml`.

### Changes

- 20ebf4e fix: switch tag-on-merge to push trigger for fork PR token permissions (#140)

## [1.9.5] - 2026-08-01

### Summary

Replaces manual `npm publish` with fully automated trusted publishing (OIDC) via GitHub Actions. The agent never touches npm credentials or pushes tags — it opens a release PR from its fork, and merging that PR triggers the entire pipeline: auto-tagging, npm publish with provenance attestations, GitHub release creation, and Docker image builds. This closes the Socket.dev supply chain score gap by adding provenance to the npm package (the Docker images already had cosign + SLSA).

> **Not published to npm / no version-tagged Docker images.** The `pull_request` trigger gave the workflow a read-only `GITHUB_TOKEN` for fork PRs, so `git push` of the tag failed with 403. Fixed in 1.9.6 (trigger) and 1.9.7 (publish merge).

### Changes

- fb979e4 feat: automated npm trusted publishing (OIDC) + tag-on-merge release pipeline (#130)

## [1.9.4] - 2026-07-31

### Summary

Maintenance release that rolls up the 7-day-cooldown dependency bumps across all three agent images and backports an upstream hermes-agent Slack Block Kit fix. `pi-coding-agent` moves to 0.80.10 (Kimi Coding adaptive-thinking compatibility), `opencode-ai` jumps to 1.18.4 (completing the Desktop v2 migration, adding skill discovery, Snowflake Cortex, session snapshots/revert, and a `--mini` CLI mode), and `hermes-agent` moves to v2026.7.20 — Hermes v0.19.0 "Quicksilver," a speed release (~80% faster first-token) that also adds in-terminal subscription management, default smart approvals, and Bitwarden/1Password secret sources. `pnpm`, `mise`, `uv`, and `cosign` are bumped as well.

The harness-level change applies a new build-time patch (`hermes-agent-slack-invalid-blocks-fix.patch`) over the `v2026.7.20` tree so Slack stops rejecting entire messages when a Block Kit text element ends up with zero characters (blank quote separators, empty table cells, empty code fences).

### Dependency Updates

- updated pnpm from 10.33.2 to 10.34.5
- updated `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` from 0.80.9 to 0.80.10
- updated mise from 2026.4.23 to 2026.7.11
- updated opencode-ai from 1.15.10 to 1.18.4
- updated uv from 0.11.19 to 0.11.30
- updated cosign from 3.0.6 to 3.1.2
- updated hermes-agent from v2026.7.7.2 to v2026.7.20

### Upstream Release Notes

#### @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent 0.80.9 → 0.80.10

**v0.80.10** — Kimi Coding models now use adaptive thinking correctly (K3 exposes its supported `max` level and replays empty-signature thinking blocks); fixed inherited Kimi K3 pricing/thinking metadata; restored xAI models that 0.80.9 had removed from the catalog.

#### opencode-ai 1.15.10 → 1.18.4

**v1.15.11–v1.15.13** — `headerTimeout` provider config (10s default for OpenAI setups); experimental OpenAI WebSocket response transport; ACP `acp-next` prompts/slash-commands/usage; Anthropic Opus 4.7+ adaptive reasoning keeps summarized thinking; session custom metadata via API/SDK; responsive/configurable TUI prompt.

**v1.16.0–v1.16.2** — Managed workspace cloning that keeps dirty and untracked files; move sessions between workspaces; OpenAI models through AWS Bedrock; **skill discovery and file-based agent loading**; `run --replay` for interactive session replay; added **Snowflake Cortex** provider; subagents can be backgrounded; edit tool now refuses loose matches that could overwrite the wrong code.

**v1.17.0–v1.17.5** — New `fff`-backed faster file search; Cohere North model support; `X-Session-Id` headers for sticky-routing proxies; connector-based auth flows and stored provider credentials; v2 API endpoints to create/fetch sessions; `cwd` support for local MCP servers; Snowflake Cortex external-browser OAuth.

**v1.17.6–v1.17.10** — Broad MCP compatibility/capability fixes; **MCP resource template listing and read tools**; Opencode-managed provider integration; added a **`--mini` CLI mode**.

**v1.17.11–v1.17.15** — **Session snapshots and revert** (roll a session back to an earlier message including file changes); Chrome-style `mod+1`–`mod+9` tab cycle shortcuts and draggable desktop tabs; `code mode` MCP adapter for confined orchestration scripts; yolo auto-approve permission mode in the TUI.

**v1.17.16–v1.17.20** — Composer add-menu (files, commands, context, shell mode); inline file-browser tabs in the side panel; Grok reasoning-effort variants and xAI prompt-cache/PDF handling; Meta and GitHub Copilot model-handling fixes; GPT-5.6 / Azure updates.

**v1.18.0–v1.18.4** — **Completed the Desktop v2 migration** with a setting to toggle between new and old layouts during the transition; subagents can no longer launch nested subagents by default (configurable `subagent_depth`); Kimi adaptive-thinking controls on Anthropic-compatible providers; restored Azure Cognitive Services endpoint support.

#### hermes-agent v2026.7.7.2 → v2026.7.20

**v2026.7.20 — Hermes v0.19.0 "The Quicksilver Release"** — Cold-start time-to-first-token dropped ~80% (4.3s → 0.9s) across CLI, gateway, TUI, desktop, and cron; reasoning models stream their thinking live by default; 20+ desktop perf PRs (14× faster streaming markdown, virtualized diffs, snappy session switching). **`/subscription` and `/topup`** let you manage your Nous plan entirely from the terminal (with matching desktop billing tab). **Smart approvals are now the default** — an LLM reviewer judges flagged commands, plus user-defined deny rules and `/deny <reason>`. **Bitwarden and 1Password secret sources** via a pluggable `SecretSource` interface (multiple vaults, precedence, provenance). Live subagent transcripts (`tail -f`) plus durable background delegation; a durable delivery-obligation ledger so finished responses survive gateway crashes (Telegram/Discord/Slack); profile-based gateway message routing (one bot token, many isolated profiles). New providers Fireworks AI, DeepInfra, and Upstage Solar; new models GPT-5.6, grok-4.5 GA, kimi-k3, claude-fable-5/sonnet-5; `max`/`ultra` reasoning tiers with per-model overrides; `hermes sessions export` (Markdown/Quarto/HTML/HF trace, with `--redact`); a security-hardening round across credential surfaces.

### Changes

- dbbf913 chore: bump eligible dependencies (7-day cooldown) (#133)

## [1.9.3] - 2026-07-28

### Summary

Hermes-only patch release. Backports upstream hermes-agent PR [#64189](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pull/64189), applied at image build time over the `v2026.7.7.2` tree baked into the hermes image, so plugin-registered secret sources such as `aws_ssm` are actually consulted during the first process's initial environment load. Previously they registered after the first `load_hermes_dotenv()` call and were silently ignored, emitting `secrets.sources names unknown source(s)`. No CLI, adapter, or dependency changes.

### Changes

- 27d70bc fix(hermes): backport secret-source re-pull after plugin discovery (#136)

## [1.9.2] - 2026-07-18

### Summary

Maintenance release with a new home-directory safety guard, Chromium support for the hermes agent, and several dependency bumps. Harness now refuses to run from your home directory by default (it would mount all of `$HOME`, exposing dotfiles and credentials); pass the new `--mount-entire-home` flag to opt in. The hermes image gains the shared libraries Chromium needs to run Playwright browsers, and the hermes web UI is now pre-built into the image. Also bumps `pi-coding-agent` to 0.80.9 and `hermes-agent` to v2026.7.7.2 (Hermes Agent v0.18.x).

```bash
# harness refuses to run from $HOME by default; opt in explicitly:
harness --mount-entire-home
```

### Dependency Updates

- updated `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` from `0.79.2` to `0.80.9`
- updated `hermes-agent` from `v2026.6.19` to `v2026.7.7.2`
- updated `gh` from `2.95.0` to `2.96.0`
- downgraded `cosign` from `3.1.1` to `3.0.6`

### Upstream Release Notes

**v0.79.6** — Fixed the HTTP dispatcher to preserve a caller's deliberate `fetch` override; fixed inherited OpenCode Go DeepSeek V4 thinking-off compatibility.

**v0.79.7** — Automatic light/dark theme mode that follows terminal color-scheme changes; `pi update` now updates pi only by default (use `--all` for packages); extension helpers `CONFIG_DIR_NAME` and edit-diff exports; Warp terminal inline image rendering.

**v0.79.8** — Selective provider base entry points (`pi-ai/base`, `pi-agent-core/base`); Mistral prompt caching with cached-token accounting; post-compaction token estimates in compact results/events; `openrouter/fusion` alias.

**v0.79.10** — Extension compaction events now carry `reason`/`willRetry`; safer `pi update` that installs the exact checked version and links the changelog; fixed `find` tool handling of nested-repo gitignore rules.

**v0.80.1** — Fixes only: Bedrock scoped `AWS_PROFILE` endpoint resolution, Fireworks Anthropic-compat session-affinity/tool defaults, and Together MiniMax M2.7 metadata.

**v0.80.2** — `ApiKeyCredential` now uses the `type: "api_key"` discriminator with provider-scoped `env`; renamed `ExecutionEnvExecOptions` → `ShellExecOptions`; restored legacy compat stream aliases and the `detectCompat` fallback; fixed request-scoped auth resolution for providers like Cloudflare.

**v0.80.3** — Anthropic Claude Sonnet 5 support (adaptive thinking); `outputPad` horizontal padding; configurable `externalEditor`; RPC `get_entries`/`get_tree`; extension `session_info_changed` events; modern Azure Foundry endpoints; default OpenAI model now `gpt-5.5`.

**v0.80.5** — Maintenance release (no curated changelog).

**v0.80.7** — **Breaking:** removed `compat.sendSessionIdHeader`, replaced by `compat.sessionAffinityFormat`. Cache-friendly dynamic tool loading (Anthropic/OpenAI Responses preserve the cache prefix); `Ctrl+X` to copy the last assistant message; Fable 5 `xhigh`/`max` thinking; `toolChoice` support for OpenAI/Codex Responses; fixed system-prompt date-based cache invalidation.

**v0.80.8** — Unified `ModelRuntime` (model config, provider-owned `/login`, dynamic catalogs); live `/model` catalog refresh + `pi update --models`; xAI device-code OAuth and Grok 4.5 Responses. **SDK breaking changes:** replaced `authStorage`/`modelRegistry` with async `modelRuntime`, removed redundant `ModelRuntime` projections, and `ModelRegistry.refresh()` is now async.

**v0.80.9** — Kimi K3 support across built-in providers with progressive (deferred) extension tool activation; xAI login uses a prefilled "Sign in with SuperGrok or X Premium" link and the default xAI model is now Grok 4.5; removed older Grok 3/4 variants from the xAI catalog.

#### hermes-agent v2026.6.19 → v2026.7.7.2

**v2026.7.1** (Hermes Agent v0.18.0, "The Judgment Release") —
- Closed 100% of open P0/P1 issues and PRs (~700 highest-priority items) in a focused clean-sweep.
- Mixture-of-Agents became a first-class selectable model (`moa` provider) showing each reference model's reasoning and live-streaming the aggregator's answer.
- `/goal` completion contracts plus self-verification of coding work against project checks; `/learn` distills reusable skills; `/journey` is a playable timeline of memories/skills; `delegate_task` can fan out background subagents.
- Google Vertex AI provider (auto-refreshing service-account OAuth tokens); gateway scale-to-zero and external drain coordination; first-class coding Projects in the desktop app; a large security hardening round.

**v2026.7.7** (Hermes Agent v0.18.1) — Patch release rolling up ~660 PRs merged since v0.18.0 (Windows installer self-healing, dashboard/gateway fixes, WhatsApp dashboard pairing, MCP/provider fixes, stability work). Full curated notes deferred to v0.19.0.

**v2026.7.7.2** (Hermes Agent v0.18.2) — Same-day patch unpinning the WhatsApp Baileys dependency from a git commit to the published 7.0.0-rc13, making tagged-release Docker builds reliable.

## [1.9.1] - 2026-06-27

### Summary

Maintenance release bundling dependency updates and documentation/test improvements. Bumps `gh` to 2.95.0 and `hermes-agent` to v2026.6.19 (Hermes Agent v0.17.0). Removes a fabricated `cp -rn` seed mechanism that was incorrectly documented for the hermes entrypoint, refactors the monolithic e2e test file into focused modules, and adds README documentation for apple/container kernel bootstrap, multi-provider env files, and container runtime resource configuration.

### Dependency Updates

- updated `gh` from `2.94.0` to `2.95.0`
- updated `hermes-agent` from `v2026.6.5` to `v2026.6.19`

### Upstream Release Notes

#### hermes-agent v2026.6.5 → v2026.6.19

**v2026.6.19** (Hermes Agent v0.17.0, "The Reach Release") —
- New messaging channels: iMessage via Photon Spectrum (no Mac relay required), the official WhatsApp Business Cloud API (no bridge process), the Raft agent-network gateway, and SimpleX group support.
- Background/async subagents via `delegate_task(background=true)`, image-to-image editing in `image_generate`, Automation Blueprints, and Cursor's Composer model reachable through an xAI Grok subscription.
- The `memory` tool gained atomic batch operations; the desktop app expanded substantially (subagent watch-windows, installable VS Code themes, composer model selector); the dashboard gained a full profile builder and a rehauled Skills Hub.
- The skill curator no longer spends aux-model budget on routine runs (consolidation is now opt-in); dashboard login was hardened; 300+ issues closed plus a security round.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-06-20

### Summary

Adds support for Apple's native `container` CLI as an alternative container runtime on macOS 26 / Apple Silicon. Set `HARNESS_CONTAINER_RUNTIME=apple` to use it. The apple runtime runs OCI images as lightweight Linux microVMs under Apple's Virtualization framework, providing hardware-assisted isolation. The `--security-opt` flags used under Docker are not applied under the apple runtime (each workload has its own guest kernel, so the seccomp profile's host-kernel role is subsumed by the VM boundary); capability restrictions (`--cap-drop=ALL --cap-add=NET_RAW`) remain enforced. Image verification (cosign + SLSA provenance) works identically under both runtimes.

- 4a1e56b rfc: HARNESS_CONTAINER_RUNTIME for apple/container support (#107)

## [1.8.6] - 2026-06-20

### Summary

Fixes zensical documentation build failures and adds a PR docs build check to CI. Improves documentation for git/gh auth configuration persistence (including gh PAT login), documents `.config` and mise data/state persistence in deployment guides, adds `HARNESS_CLOUD_MODE=1` to all deployment guides for cloud mode consistency, and fixes `.hermes-openrouter` references to `.hermes`. Also disables in-container self-update notifications for all agents to reduce noise.

## [1.8.5] - 2026-06-19

### Summary

Adds project-level config persistence — the container's `~/.config` is now persisted at the project (cwd) level and shared across every agent working in the same project, so tool configs (e.g. jj) survive across interactive runs with no new flags. Also removes `sudo` and sudoers from the base image and renames the package scope from `capotej` to `boldblackai` across the repo. Bundled agent bumps: `pi-coding-agent` 0.73.1 → 0.79.2 (now published under the `@earendil-works` scope) and `hermes-agent` v2026.5.29.2 → v2026.6.5.

### Dependency Updates

- updated `pi-coding-agent` from `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent@0.73.1` to `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent@0.79.2`
- updated `hermes-agent` from `v2026.5.29.2` to `v2026.6.5`
- updated `gh` from `2.93.0` to `2.94.0`
- updated `uv` from `0.11.16` to `0.11.19`
- updated `cosign` from `3.0.6` to `3.1.1`

### Upstream Release Notes

#### @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent 0.73.1 → 0.79.2

**v0.74.0** — Repository and package references moved to `earendil-works/pi-mono` and the `@earendil-works/*` scopes.

#### hermes-agent v2026.5.29.2 → v2026.6.5

**v2026.6.5** (v0.16.0, "The Surface Release") — New native desktop app (macOS/Linux/Windows) with in-app self-update, drag-and-drop files, an inline model picker, and concurrent multi-profile sessions that can connect to remote Hermes gateways over OAuth or username/password. The web dashboard grew a full admin panel (messaging channels, MCP catalog, credentials, webhooks, memory, pluggable OIDC / username-password login), plus a "Quick Setup via Nous Portal" first-run path. Also: trimmed default skill set, NVIDIA/skills as a trusted tap, fuzzy model picker everywhere (desktop/web/TUI/CLI), and `/undo [N]` across all interfaces. Rode along with 2 P0 + 62 P1 closures and a security round (Starlette CVE pin, SSRF off-loop hardening, subprocess credential stripping).

## [1.8.3] - 2026-06-05

### Summary

Bumps the GitHub CLI (`gh`) to 2.93.0 and hermes-agent to v2026.5.29.2. The hermes-agent update brings the full v0.15.x release series — a major refactor that collapses the core agent loop by 76%, adds a kanban multi-agent platform with swarm topology, dramatically improves cold-start performance, adds Bitwarden Secrets Manager integration, an interactive MCP catalog picker, and fixes a dashboard infinite-reload loop in Docker loopback mode.

### Dependency Updates

- updated `gh` from 2.92.0 to 2.93.0
- updated hermes-agent from v2026.5.16 to v2026.5.29.2

### Upstream Release Notes

#### hermes-agent v2026.5.16 → v2026.5.29.2

**v2026.5.28** — The Velocity Release (1,302 commits, 747 PRs). Core `run_agent.py` reduced from 16K to 3.8K lines (-76%). Kanban grew into a full multi-agent platform with swarm topology, orchestrator auto-decomposition, per-task model overrides, scheduled tasks, and worktree-per-task. Cold-start perf improved: another second shaved, 47% fewer per-conversation function calls. `session_search` is 4,500× faster. Bitwarden Secrets Manager replaces per-provider API keys. Skill bundles, interactive MCP catalog picker, Ink TUI multi-session orchestrator. Two new image_gen providers (Krea 2, FAL). xAI deep integration (Web Search plugin, natural TTS, base_url leak guard). 15 P0 + 65 P1 fixes.

**v2026.5.29** — Hotfix for v0.15.0. Dashboard infinite-reload loop in loopback/Docker mode fixed. Docker `--insecure` is now an explicit env opt-in (`HERMES_DASHBOARD_INSECURE=1`). MCP bare command resolution fixed for Docker. Kanban worker SIGTERM fix. Full skills.sh catalog (858 → 19,932 entries). Hindsight narrowed to observation-only.

**v2026.5.29.2** — Packaging fix: bundled `plugin.yaml` manifests now shipped in wheel and sdist.

### Changes

- c0cbe30 chore: bump gh 2.92.0 -> 2.93.0 and hermes-agent v2026.5.16 -> v2026.5.29.2 (#91)

## [1.8.2] - 2026-06-01

### Summary

Adds context file mounting — `~/.agents/AGENTS.md` and `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` are now automatically bind-mounted into the agent's context directory so cross-agent rules apply inside the container. Disable with `--no-context-files` (or `-nc`). Adds `openssh-client` to the base image and `libolm-dev` with the `matrix` extra to the hermes variant, enabling Matrix protocol support. Also includes a documentation website (GitHub Pages) and AWS deployment guide for hermes claws.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-05-25

### Summary

Introduces cloud/local mode (`HARNESS_CLOUD_MODE`) — passing `--env-file` now automatically switches agents to cloud mode where they auto-detect providers from API keys in the file, instead of hardcoding OpenRouter. Use `--local` to force local mode even with `--env-file` (e.g. `harness -e .env --local -p "..."`). Simplifies hermes persistence to a single directory and scopes npm persistence to the pi adapter. Adds multi-provider configs for opencode (Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, ZAI).

### Changes

- 967f1c2 scope mount to pi adapter, biome fixes for pi-lens (#79)
- e1ace6c stop hardcoding openrouter, start multi provider support (#78)

## [1.8.0] - 2026-05-24

### Summary

Migrates persistence to XDG data directories with per-agent `mise` support — interactive runs now store agent state, tool data, and trust settings under `$XDG_DATA_HOME/harness/<project>/<agent>/`. Ensures `npm install -g` works correctly for the harness user by configuring a non-root prefix. Bumps all three agent dependencies: pi 0.71.1 → 0.73.1, opencode 1.14.31 → 1.15.10, and hermes v2026.5.7 → v2026.5.16 (major v0.14.0 "Foundation" release).

### Dependency Updates
- updated `debian:stable-slim` base image digest
- updated `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` from 0.71.1 to 0.73.1
- updated `opencode-ai` from 1.14.31 to 1.15.10
- updated `uv` from 0.11.8 to 0.11.16
- updated `hermes-agent` from v2026.5.7 to v2026.5.16
- updated `python-telegram-bot` from 22.7 to 22.6
- removed `croniter` from hermes image

Fixed `grep`/`find` tool argument injection for flag-like patterns, DeepSeek V4 Flash `xhigh` thinking support, and numerous Windows/WSL/Vertex fixes.

**v0.71.1** — Added `websocket-cached` transport option for OpenAI Codex provider, keeping the same WebSocket open and sending only new conversation items after the first request.

#### opencode-ai 1.14.25 → 1.14.31

**v1.14.26** — Fixed config parsing to preserve permission rule order; fixed OpenRouter DeepSeek reasoning output; added Zed editor selection support.

**v1.14.27** — Added configurable default shell for terminals and agent commands; reduced terminal noise during TUI workspace creation.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-26

### Summary
Adds `mise` (polyglot version manager) to the base image for in-container language toolchain management, and introduces `tini` as PID 1 across all container variants for proper zombie process reaping and signal forwarding. Expands the e2e test suite with coverage for persistence behavior, `--env-file` forwarding across agents, and CLI documentation completeness.

### Changes
- 0710e24 test(hermes): no -m and no -p emits exactly ['hermes','chat'] (#25)
- ca2f1e3 test(opencode): --env-file is forwarded for non-pi adapters too (#24)

## [1.4.6] - 2026-04-26

### Summary
Fixes `--provider ollama` not being forwarded when `-m` is used without `-e` in local mode (e.g. `harness -m "qwen/qwen3.5-9b" -p "..."` now correctly routes to Ollama). Switches the uv cooldown enforcement from a `uv.toml` config file to `--exclude-newer` passed directly to `uv pip install` at image build time — more reliable and removes a footgun. Adds a comprehensive e2e test suite for the CLI. Also ships major upstream updates across all three agents and core dependency bumps.

### Upstream Release Notes

#### @mariozechner/pi-coding-agent 0.67.68 → 0.70.2

**v0.68.0** — Configurable streaming working indicator for extensions via `ctx.ui.setWorkingIndicator()`; `before_agent_start` now exposes `systemPromptOptions` so extensions can inspect structured system-prompt inputs.

**v0.68.1** — Added Fireworks provider support with `FIREWORKS_API_KEY` auth and default model `accounts/fireworks/models/kimi-k2p6`; configurable inline tool image width via `terminal.imageWidthCells`.

**v0.69.0** — TypeBox 1.x migration for extensions and SDK; TypeBox-native tool argument validation now works in eval-restricted runtimes (e.g. Cloudflare Workers); stacked extension autocomplete providers via `ctx.ui.addAutocompleteProvider()`.

**v0.70.0** — Searchable fuzzy-filter login flow for `/login` provider selector; GPT-5.5 Codex support (`openai-codex/gpt-5.5`) with `xhigh` reasoning; OSC 9;4 terminal progress indicators are now opt-in.

**v0.70.1** — DeepSeek provider support with V4 Flash/Pro models and `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`; provider request timeout/retry controls via `retry.provider.{timeoutMs,maxRetries,maxRetryDelayMs}`.

**v0.70.2** — Fixed provider retry/timeout forwarding to omit undefined fields, avoiding downstream SDK validation errors (e.g. `timeout must be an integer`).

#### opencode-ai 1.14.18 → 1.14.25

**v1.14.19** — Fixed circular session schema startup failure; renamed `compaction` setting to `preserve_recent_tokens`; preserved concurrent edits to the same file; added NVIDIA as a built-in provider.

**v1.14.21** — LSP pull diagnostics support (C#, Kotlin); improved session compaction for long threads; C# support switched to Roslyn Language Server; Mistral high-reasoning variant.

**v1.14.22** — Respects `.npmrc` settings during npm installs; projects can store persistent custom icon overrides.

**v1.14.23** — Respects custom `.npmrc` registry settings for package version checks; TUI renders all non-synthetic text in user messages.

**v1.14.24** — Fixed DeepSeek assistant messages (reasoning always included); experimental HTTP API endpoints for MCP server status and file listing/reading.

**v1.14.25** — Fixed permission config to preserve rule order with full IntelliSense for tool permission keys; LSP permission prompts include operation, file, and cursor position; shell commands keep correct working directory after login shell startup; Roslyn LSP support for Razor and `.cshtml` files.

#### hermes-agent v2026.4.16 → v2026.4.23

**v2026.4.23** — Major v0.11.0 release: new Ink-based TUI (`hermes --tui`), native AWS Bedrock support, pluggable transport architecture, 17th messaging platform (QQBot), GPT-5.5 via Codex OAuth, and dramatically expanded plugin surface. Covers ~2 weeks of work (1,556 commits, 761 PRs).

## [1.4.5] - 2026-04-25

### Summary
Enforces a 1-week cooldown on dependency resolution inside the container for both pnpm (`minimumReleaseAge=10080`) and uv (`exclude-newer = "7 days"`), rejecting packages published within the last 7 days to mitigate supply-chain attacks. Also expands the `harness` user's passwordless sudo access to include `dpkg`, surfaces `HARNESS_IMAGE_TAG` in `--help` output, and documents fly.io deployment with `GH_TOKEN`.

### Changes
- 093de49 feat: add dpkg to passwordless sudoers for harness user (#17)
- e064316 feat: enforce 1-week dependency cooldown on pnpm and uv (#15)
- d50d603 docs: surface HARNESS_IMAGE_TAG in --help output (#13)
- 879c9f9 docs: add GH_TOKEN to fly.io setup (#14)

## [1.4.4] - 2026-04-25

### Summary
Installs `gh` CLI v2.91.0 in the base image with checksum verification for both amd64 and arm64. The PR workflow now builds and tests both architectures natively.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-04-22

### Summary
Housekeeping release: adds a LICENSE file, pins the pnpm package manager version, and switches the Dockerfile shell to bash with pipefail — fixing `mkdir` brace expansion failures in the hermes image.

### Changes
- 1c3661a set pnpm version
- 8b9c442 pnpm lint
- eea47e1 add LICENSE

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-22

### Summary
Interactive runs now persist agent state by default: harness creates a `.harness/<agent>/` directory in your working directory and bind-mounts it into the container, letting agents resume sessions and retain memories across invocations. One-shot runs (`-p "..."` or piped stdin) remain implicitly ephemeral; use `--ephemeral` to force-disable persistence for interactive runs. Image signature verification results are now cached per digest to avoid redundant cosign checks on repeated invocations.

### Changes
- fef0a0b cache the image signature verification per digest
- 2f56b75 persist agent data by default in .harness, --ephemeral to opt out

## [1.3.3] - 2026-04-21

### Summary
The hermes sub-image now includes [`tirith`](https://github.com/sheeki03/tirith) v0.2.12 and adds full cosign attestation verification for the `uv` binary at build time. The README documents the `HARNESS_IMAGE_TAG` environment variable for overriding the Docker image tag.

### Dependency Updates

- added cosign attestation verification for `uv` in hermes image

### Changes
- fcb209d verify uv and cosign
- ae3c7da install tirith in hermes image

## [1.3.2] - 2026-04-19

### Summary
The container now runs as a dedicated non-root `harness` user for improved security. Image verification is enabled by default on startup (skip with `--no-verify`). Updated `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` to 0.67.68.

### Dependency Updates
- updated `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` from 0.66.1 to 0.67.68

### Changes

## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-19

### Summary
Adds build provenance attestation to the CI pipeline for improved supply chain security.

### Changes
- ad23df9 attest build provenance

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-19

### Summary
Agent backends (`opencode`, `hermes`) have been split into separate sub-images that are dynamically loaded at runtime, keeping the base image lean. Image verification on startup is now supported (experimental, opt-in via `HARNESS_VERIFY=1`): harness checks that the container image was signed by the official CI workflow using cosign before running. Disable with `--no-verify`.

### Dependency Updates
- removed `opencode-ai@1.14.18` from base image (moved to subimage)
- removed `uv@0.11.6` and `hermes-agent@v2026.4.16` from base image (moved to subimage)

### Changes
- 5b7c4fe split up agents into subimages, dynamically load them
- 79542cd verify harness image on start (experimental, behind HARNESS_VERIFY=1)

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-19

### Summary
Adds the [`hermes`](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) agent backend by NousResearch. The Docker image was also optimized by removing unused packages (`vim`, `iputils-ping`) and cleaning up caches to reduce image size.

### Dependency Updates
- added `uv` 0.11.6 (build stage for hermes installation)
- added `hermes-agent` v2026.4.16

### Changes
- 63fef70 pin harness image
- f385189 hermes agent
