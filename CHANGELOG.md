# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Summary

Promotes Apple's `container` CLI as the default container runtime on macOS. `HARNESS_CONTAINER_RUNTIME=apple` is no longer needed — harness auto-detects whether `container` is on PATH and prefers it over docker (macOS only; on other platforms a same-named binary is an unrelated tool and docker stays default). Set `HARNESS_CONTAINER_RUNTIME=docker` to force docker. The `apple` value is now a deprecated alias: it still selects the apple runtime but prints a deprecation warning.

### Changes

- Promote container CLI to default runtime via macOS-gated auto-detection (#114)
- Keep `HARNESS_CONTAINER_RUNTIME=apple` as a deprecated alias instead of hard-failing
- Ignore a `container` binary on PATH outside macOS (apple/container is macOS-only)

## [1.9.0] - 2026-06-20

### Summary

Adds support for Apple's native `container` CLI as an alternative container runtime on macOS 26 / Apple Silicon. Set `HARNESS_CONTAINER_RUNTIME=apple` to use it. The apple runtime runs OCI images as lightweight Linux microVMs under Apple's Virtualization framework, providing hardware-assisted isolation. The `--security-opt` flags used under Docker are not applied under the apple runtime (each workload has its own guest kernel, so the seccomp profile's host-kernel role is subsumed by the VM boundary); capability restrictions (`--cap-drop=ALL --cap-add=NET_RAW`) remain enforced. Image verification (cosign + SLSA provenance) works identically under both runtimes.

- 4a1e56b rfc: HARNESS_CONTAINER_RUNTIME for apple/container support (#107)

## [1.8.6] - 2026-06-20

### Summary

Fixes zensical documentation build failures and adds a PR docs build check to CI. Improves documentation for git/gh auth configuration persistence (including gh PAT login), documents `.config` and mise data/state persistence in deployment guides, adds `HARNESS_CLOUD_MODE=1` to all deployment guides for cloud mode consistency, and fixes `.hermes-openrouter` references to `.hermes`. Also disables in-container self-update notifications for all agents to reduce noise.

## [1.8.5] - 2026-06-19

### Summary

Adds project-level config persistence — the container's `~/.config` is now persisted at the project (cwd) level and shared across every agent working in the same project, so tool configs (e.g. jj) survive across interactive runs with no new flags. Also removes `sudo` and sudoers from the base image and renames the package scope from `capotej` to `boldblackai` across the repo. Bundled agent bumps: `pi-coding-agent` 0.73.1 → 0.79.2 (now published under the `@earendil-works` scope) and `hermes-agent` v2026.5.29.2 → v2026.6.5.

### Dependency Updates

- updated `pi-coding-agent` from `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent@0.73.1` to `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent@0.79.2`
- updated `hermes-agent` from `v2026.5.29.2` to `v2026.6.5`
- updated `gh` from `2.93.0` to `2.94.0`
- updated `uv` from `0.11.16` to `0.11.19`
- updated `cosign` from `3.0.6` to `3.1.1`

### Upstream Release Notes

#### @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent 0.73.1 → 0.79.2

The web dashboard grew a full admin panel (messaging channels, MCP catalog, credentials, webhooks, memory, pluggable OIDC / username-password login), plus a "Quick Setup via Nous Portal" first-run path. Also: trimmed default skill set, NVIDIA/skills as a trusted tap, fuzzy model picker everywhere (desktop/web/TUI/CLI), and `/undo [N]` across all interfaces. Rode along with 2 P0 + 62 P1 closures and a security round (Starlette CVE pin, SSRF off-loop hardening, subprocess credential stripping).

## [1.8.3] - 2026-06-05

### Summary

Bumps the GitHub CLI (`gh`) to 2.93.0 and hermes-agent to v2026.5.29.2. The hermes-agent update brings the full v0.15.x release series — a major refactor that collapses the core agent loop by 76%, adds a kanban multi-agent platform with swarm topology, dramatically improves cold-start performance, adds Bitwarden Secrets Manager integration, an interactive MCP catalog picker, and fixes a dashboard infinite-reload loop in Docker loopback mode.

### Dependency Updates

- updated `gh` from 2.92.0 to 2.93.0
- updated hermes-agent from v2026.5.16 to v2026.5.29.2

### Upstream Release Notes

#### hermes-agent v2026.5.16 → v2026.5.29.2

**v2026.5.28** — The Velocity Release (1,302 commits, 747 PRs). Core `run_agent.py` reduced from 16K to 3.8K lines (-76%). Kanban grew into a full multi-agent platform with swarm topology, orchestrator auto-decomposition, per-task model overrides, scheduled tasks, and worktree-per-task. Cold-start perf improved: another second shaved, 47% fewer per-conversation function calls. `session_search` is 4,500× faster. Bitwarden Secrets Manager replaces per-provider API keys. Skill bundles, interactive MCP catalog picker, Ink TUI multi-session orchestrator. Two new image_gen providers (Krea 2, FAL). xAI deep integration (Web Search plugin, natural TTS, base_url leak guard). 15 P0 + 65 P1 fixes.

**v2026.5.29** — Hotfix for v0.15.0. Dashboard infinite-reload loop in loopback/Docker mode fixed. Docker `--insecure` is now an explicit env opt-in (`HERMES_DASHBOARD_INSECURE=1`). MCP bare command resolution fixed for Docker. Kanban worker SIGTERM fix. Full skills.sh catalog (858 → 19,932 entries). Hindsight narrowed to observation-only.

**v2026.5.29.2** — Packaging fix: bundled `plugin.yaml` manifests now shipped in wheel and sdist.

### Changes

- c0cbe30 chore: bump gh 2.92.0 -> 2.93.0 and hermes-agent v2026.5.16 -> v2026.5.29.2 (#91)

## [1.8.2] - 2026-06-01

### Summary

Adds context file mounting — `~/.agents/AGENTS.md` and `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` are now automatically bind-mounted into the agent's context directory so cross-agent rules apply inside the container. Disable with `--no-context-files` (or `-nc`). Adds `openssh-client` to the base image and `libolm-dev` with the `matrix` extra to the hermes variant, enabling Matrix protocol support. Also includes a documentation website (GitHub Pages) and AWS deployment guide for hermes claws.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-05-25

### Summary

Introduces cloud/local mode (`HARNESS_CLOUD_MODE`) — passing `--env-file` now automatically switches agents to cloud mode where they auto-detect providers from API keys in the file, instead of hardcoding OpenRouter. Use `--local` to force local mode even with `--env-file` (e.g. `harness -e .env --local -p "..."`). Simplifies hermes persistence to a single directory and scopes npm persistence to the pi adapter. Adds multi-provider configs for opencode (Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, ZAI).

### Changes

- 967f1c2 scope mount to pi adapter, biome fixes for pi-lens (#79)
- e1ace6c stop hardcoding openrouter, start multi provider support (#78)

## [1.8.0] - 2026-05-24

### Summary

Migrates persistence to XDG data directories with per-agent `mise` support — interactive runs now store agent state, tool data, and trust settings under `$XDG_DATA_HOME/harness/<project>/<agent>/`. Ensures `npm install -g` works correctly for the harness user by configuring a non-root prefix. Bumps all three agent dependencies: pi 0.71.1 → 0.73.1, opencode 1.14.31 → 1.15.10, and hermes v2026.5.7 → v2026.5.16 (major v0.14.0 "Foundation" release).

### Dependency Updates
- updated `debian:stable-slim` base image digest
- updated `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` from 0.71.1 to 0.73.1
- updated `opencode-ai` from 1.14.31 to 1.15.10
- updated `uv` from 0.11.8 to 0.11.16
- updated `hermes-agent` from v2026.5.7 to v2026.5.16
- updated `python-telegram-bot` from 22.7 to 22.6
- removed `croniter` from hermes image

### Summary
Adds `mise` (polyglot version manager) to the base image for in-container language toolchain management, and introduces `tini` as PID 1 across all container variants for proper zombie process reaping and signal forwarding. Expands the e2e test suite with coverage for persistence behavior, `--env-file` forwarding across agents, and CLI documentation completeness.

### Changes
- 0710e24 test(hermes): no -m and no -p emits exactly ['hermes','chat'] (#25)
- ca2f1e3 test(opencode): --env-file is forwarded for non-pi adapters too (#24)
- 4783fa7 test(persist): interactive run without --ephemeral creates .harness/<agent>/ persistence dir (#23)
- 8c0e81b feat: add mise as polyglot version manager to base image (#26)
- a4fd46a test(pi): inverse case  env-file + -m omits --provider ollama (#20)
- 984598e chore: add tini as PID 1 for zombie reaping and signal forwarding (#19)
- d07b6a4 test(cli): assert HARNESS_IMAGE_TAG is documented in --help (#21)

### Dependency Updates
- added `mise` v2026.4.23 (polyglot version manager)
- added `tini` v0.19.0 (PID 1 init process)

## [1.4.6] - 2026-04-26

### Summary
Fixes `--provider ollama` not being forwarded when `-m` is used without `-e` in local mode (e.g. `harness -m "qwen/qwen3.5-9b" -p "..."` now correctly routes to Ollama). Switches the uv cooldown enforcement from a `uv.toml` config file to `--exclude-newer` passed directly to `uv pip install` at image build time — more reliable and removes a footgun. Adds a comprehensive e2e test suite for the CLI. Also ships major upstream updates across all three agents and core dependency bumps.

### Changes
- 7852c25 test: update --model test to reflect --provider ollama in local mode
- f1de7e0 docs: clarify -m model flag works in local mode with HuggingFace IDs
- 359ae3f fix(pi): pass --provider ollama when -m is used without -e
- 7003bf5 fix markdownlint
- 9cb0a47 readme
- b812f27 test: comprehensive e2e tests for the harness CLI (#5)
- bae109d fix: enforce uv cooldown via --exclude-newer flag and add hermes cooldown to check-deps skill (#18)

### Dependency Updates
- updated `debian:stable-slim` base image digest
- updated `pnpm` from 10.33.0 to 10.33.2
- updated `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` from 0.67.68 to 0.70.2

## [1.4.5] - 2026-04-25

### Summary
Enforces a 1-week cooldown on dependency resolution inside the container for both pnpm (`minimumReleaseAge=10080`) and uv (`exclude-newer = "7 days"`), rejecting packages published within the last 7 days to mitigate supply-chain attacks. Also expands the `harness` user's passwordless sudo access to include `dpkg`, surfaces `HARNESS_IMAGE_TAG` in `--help` output, and documents fly.io deployment with `GH_TOKEN`.

### Changes
- 093de49 feat: add dpkg to passwordless sudoers for harness user (#17)
- e064316 feat: enforce 1-week dependency cooldown on pnpm and uv (#15)
- d50d603 docs: surface HARNESS_IMAGE_TAG in --help output (#13)
- 879c9f9 docs: add GH_TOKEN to fly.io setup (#14)
- b1914b3 bump github actions

## [1.4.4] - 2026-04-25

- 8b9c442 pnpm lint
- eea47e1 add LICENSE

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-22

### Summary
Interactive runs now persist agent state by default: harness creates a `.harness/<agent>/` directory in your working directory and bind-mounts it into the container, letting agents resume sessions and retain memories across invocations. One-shot runs (`-p "..."` or piped stdin) remain implicitly ephemeral; use `--ephemeral` to force-disable persistence for interactive runs. Image signature verification results are now cached per digest to avoid redundant cosign checks on repeated invocations.

### Changes
- fef0a0b cache the image signature verification per digest
- 2f56b75 persist agent data by default in .harness, --ephemeral to opt out

## [1.3.3] - 2026-04-21

### Summary
The hermes sub-image now includes [`tirith`](https://github.com/sheeki03/tirith) v0.2.12 and adds full cosign attestation verification for the `uv` binary at build time. The README documents the `HARNESS_IMAGE_TAG` environment variable for overriding the Docker image tag.

### Dependency Updates
- added `tirith` 0.2.12 to hermes image
- added cosign attestation verification for `uv` in hermes image

### Changes
- fcb209d verify uv and cosign
- ae3c7da install tirith in hermes image

## [1.3.2] - 2026-04-19

### Summary
The container now runs as a dedicated non-root `harness` user for improved security. Image verification is enabled by default on startup (skip with `--no-verify`). Updated `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` to 0.67.68.

### Dependency Updates
- updated `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` from 0.66.1 to 0.67.68

### Changes

## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-19

### Summary
Adds build provenance attestation to the CI pipeline for improved supply chain security.

### Changes
- ad23df9 attest build provenance

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-19

### Summary
Agent backends (`opencode`, `hermes`) have been split into separate sub-images that are dynamically loaded at runtime, keeping the base image lean. Image verification on startup is now supported (experimental, opt-in via `HARNESS_VERIFY=1`): harness checks that the container image was signed by the official CI workflow using cosign before running. Disable with `--no-verify`.

### Dependency Updates
- removed `opencode-ai@1.14.18` from base image (moved to subimage)
- removed `uv@0.11.6` and `hermes-agent@v2026.4.16` from base image (moved to subimage)

### Changes
- 5b7c4fe split up agents into subimages, dynamically load them
- 79542cd verify harness image on start (experimental, behind HARNESS_VERIFY=1)

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-19

### Summary
Adds the [`hermes`](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) agent backend by NousResearch. The Docker image was also optimized by removing unused packages (`vim`, `iputils-ping`) and cleaning up caches to reduce image size.

### Dependency Updates
- added `uv` 0.11.6 (build stage for hermes installation)
- added `hermes-agent` v2026.4.16

### Changes
- 63fef70 pin harness image
